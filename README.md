Source Engine 2013 MP Coop Base Beta

An attempt to re-vive community made mods for Source Engine, specifically co-op.

This does not include any game binaries/assets what so ever. This is simply the `mp` ( Multiplayer ) Source code for Source Engine 2013 with some tweaks. This is not really for re-distribtion, more for personal tracking. A polished, clean configurable version is the evnetual goal.

This is provided as is, and I am not liable for any damage done to you or your property. Once again, this is maninly for version tracking for me. A more polished, well rounded configurable version is the end-goal for public use.

Basic Features/Ideas:
 - Fix NPC/Animations
 - Fix Map Transitions
 - Add Gibbing
 - New Models/Textures ( Not included. )
 - Ironsights
 - Gluon Gun 
 - Some other various failed experiments
 
Concept/Play Material:
 - You should currently be able to play the HL2 campaign as multiplayer, without major hiccups and transitions. Known Issues:
      * NPC Allies Scripting/Animated Game sequences: May hang up unless the player is near them, etc. Need to re-write the UTIL_GetPlayer() to grab the nearest player or some such
 - It should be possible to import any other materials/maps from HL2:EP1/EP2 or any other source games. I believe this should be possible with Gameinfo.txt but I have yet to properly set this up.
